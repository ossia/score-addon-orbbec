/**
 * @file DepthCameraImu.hpp
 * @brief Publish a camera's inertial samples as `<cam>/imu/accel` and `gyro`.
 *
 * These sit at the device root beside `rgb` and `depth`, not under `controls`:
 * they are what the camera measures, whereas `controls/imu/gyro_odr` and its
 * neighbours are how it is configured. Same word, opposite direction.
 *
 * Published straight from the camera's thread, which is the point -- an IMU at
 * 200Hz is only useful while it is current, and routing it through the Qt event
 * loop would add a frame of latency to the one thing here that has none. That
 * is also how every push-based ossia device behaves; an OSC device runs its
 * parameters' callbacks on the network thread in exactly the same way.
