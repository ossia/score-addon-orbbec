/**
 * @file DepthCameraControls.hpp
 * @brief Publish a camera's settings as `<cam>/controls/<group>/<name>`.
 *
 * The backend side of this is depthcam_abi.h's list_controls/get_control/
 * set_control. Nothing here names a specific control or a specific camera: an
 * Orbbec publishes its ~50 properties, a RealSense its options, an Azure Kinect
 * its colour controls and a Kinect v1 its tilt motor, all through the same
 * three calls, and the grouping comes from the identifier the backend chose.
 *
 * Three things shape the implementation:
 *
 *  - **Nothing touches the camera on a caller's thread.** Every get_control and
 *    set_control is a synchronous transfer -- a USB vendor request, or a TCP
 *    round trip for a camera on the network -- and the callers here are the
 *    GUI, the execution engine and the network layer. A worker thread owns all
 *    of it; the callers queue and return. Unfolding a node in the explorer makes
 *    score listen to every child at once, which is how a directly-polling
 *    version made the whole application stutter twice a second.
 *
 *  - **No SDK here reports a control changing.** Orbbec, librealsense, k4a,
 *    libfreenect and libfreenect2 all only offer a getter, so a read-only
 *    sensor -- a temperature, an accelerometer -- can only be tracked by asking
 *    repeatedly. Only read-only controls are polled, and only while something is
 *    listening: ossia calls protocol_base::observe() when a parameter gains its
 *    first callback and again when it loses its last. A setting we can write is
 *    one we already know the value of; it is re-read on an explicit refresh
 *    rather than continuously.
 *
 *  - **Never push into a parameter from inside that parameter's callback.**
 *    callback_container::send holds a non-recursive mutex while it runs
 *    callbacks, so a corrective push made inline deadlocks the writing thread.
 *    Everything the worker learns is published from the Qt thread instead.
